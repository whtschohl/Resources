        What is the function?
        What does a pointer has to do with it?
        How can we use pointers to the functions in our Programming?

    What is the function
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    A function is made up of micro functions. Higher level function is supported my lots of 
    lower level functions. 

    Memory of a higher lvl function:

    |--------------|
    |#Func 1st cmd | 4000
    |--------------|
    |#Func 2nd cmd | 40xx
    |--------------|
    |#Func 3rd cmd | 40xx
    |--------------|
    |     ...      | ...
    |--------------|
    |     ...      | ...
    |--------------|
    |#Last Func cmd|
    |--------------|

    This shows that every command in a function is stored in memory. Refresh Assembly 
    language knowledge to understand this better.
