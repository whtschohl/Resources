/*
    Advanced Binary Student Record Handling - Files Project
    -------------------------------------------------------

    1. Define a structure (student):
        * name, total grades, dynamic array of grades
    
    2. Print student details.
    
    3. Student record creation function. (return student)

    4. Save student record to a file. (structures pointing to 
        pointers pointing to different arrays - not so easy)

    5. Read students records from file

    6. Enhanced functionality
        * updating grades
        * add new grades
        * average grades
    
    NOTE: 
    * make sure that you are properly formating the data
    * pay close attention to memory management
    * main focus: manipulating the bin file and managing the dynamic memory
